<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Daniel T. Katalayi, born in 1990 in the vibrant city of Mbuji-Mayi, proudly carrying the nationality of 
  the Democratic Republic of the Congo. My educational journey took root at Institut Sainte Thérèse, where I achieved 
  a GCSE equivalent. Along the way, I delved into the world of SQL database management through Accord Integrated 
  Solutions. Seeking to enhance my linguistic prowess, I earned a Certificate of Orthography and Pronunciation for 
  advanced French on Udemy.</p> 

<p>My professional odyssey kicked off in December 2011 as a retailer and warehouse operator, shaping my understanding 
  of the business landscape until June 2013. A unique chapter unfolded as I took on the role of a personal driver for 
  the general manager of FPM in Kinshasa, DRC from June 2013 to January 2014.</p> 

<p>The open road beckoned, and I embraced the adventure of taxi driving from November 2013 to May 2018, utilizing my 
  personal car to navigate the bustling streets of DRC. My skills in logistics and finance came into play as I served 
  as a warehouseman and treasurer at Becki Services in DRC from December 2014 to May 2018.</p> 

<p>In July 2018, my passion for the French language led me to India, where I became a French trainer at IULE and SM 
  Academy, while also engaging in private French tutoring in the vibrant city of Bangalore. Embracing the digital age, 
  I ventured into online French teaching from 2019 to 2022, connecting with learners globally.</p> 
<p>India continued to be a significant chapter in my story, with impactful roles as a French teacher at Billabong 
  High International School in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, from June 2021 to February 2022, and later at Sanjay Ghodawat 
  International School in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, from April 2022 to October 2022.</p> 
  
<p>The year 2023 brought a change of scenery, with a brief yet impactful stint as a Cook and Multi-tasker at KFC in 
  Birmingham, United Kingdom, from April 26th to November 26th, when I proudly assumed the role of Team Leader at KFC 
  in the same vibrant city.</p> 
  
<p>As the calendar flipped to January 2024, a new chapter began with my pursuit of web development skills at Udemy, 
  highlighting my commitment to continuous learning and embracing the ever-evolving world of technology. My journey 
  is a tapestry woven with diverse experiences, a testament to adaptability, growth, and an unwavering passion for 
  knowledge.</p>
