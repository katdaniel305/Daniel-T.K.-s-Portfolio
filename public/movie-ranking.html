<h1>The Best Movies according to Daniel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Graduate (1967)</h3>
<p>Mike Nichols’ indelible comedy of alienation is that rare thing, a movie that 
really does define a generation. That’s because there has never been another movie like
it (and no, “Rushmore” doesn’t count). Dustin Hoffman, with the halting prickly-
pear neurotic charisma that would make him a star, plays a clueless college
graduate who drops out without quite rebelling, and it’s that combination of 
hostility and passivity that elevated Hoffman into a culture hero. His Ben has an 
affair with Anne Bancroft’s deliriously blasé Mrs. Robinson, then stalks her 
daughter (Katharine Ross) to campus and breaks up her wedding by screaming 
like a banshee. Now that’s an original romantic comedy. One that showcases the 
new spirit of antisocial passion in a socially acceptable — and divinely infectious — 
way.</p><br />

<h3>12 Angry Men (1957)</h3>
<p>How elemental — and riveting — is this: an entire courtroom drama set inside the 
jury room, where Henry Fonda, as the only member of the jury who suspects that 
a teenage defendant might not be guilty of murder, questions, cajoles and 
gradually convinces his fellow jurors to look more closely at the evidence. 
Sidney Lumet’s direction makes the back-and-forth dialogue so electrifying that it’s 
almost like music. The greatness of “12 Angry Men” is that it finds drama in 
discovering what America really is: a place where one man with an open mind 
can change the world.</p><br />

<h3>Women on the verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988)</h3>
<p>You never forget your first. That may be how many American 
art-house habituésthink of Pedro Almodóvar’s riotous comedy. It wasn’t his first film 
to get international distribution, but with its vivid palette and lush score, the 
movie heralds his genius and obsessions: women; their moods, hysterical and 
amusing; Hollywood cinema, camp, desire and, yes, spiked gazpacho. Before 
Penelope Cruz, Carmen Maura was for a spell the director’s muse. Here she plays a 
voice-over artist whose co-worker and lover is leaving her. The director gathered 
artists — on camera and on the set — who became his go-to company and 
underlined his wholly original sensibility.</p><br />
